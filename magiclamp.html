            <p class="text"> Starting with research into the notion of aging and the state-of-art of mainstream
                gerontechnology. I sought to challenge the current common understanding of aging and identified the
                pitfalls of mainstream gerontechnology up to date.<br>

                <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This surfaced the first tension: the mismatch between the
                    needs of the aging process and what technology
                    provides.</span> To address this tension, I proposed ‘design for openness’ as a potential design
                strategy and
                theorized an intra-action model.<br>

                Based on this model, I conducted co-speculation sessions with older participants which <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">revealed the
                    potential risks of leaving design completely open, that is the second tension, the ineffective
                    appropriation caused by a misalignment between use and design.</span><br>

                To address the misalignment, I further explored by making a concept artifact. Evaluation of the artifact
                offered rich design implications and drove the development of the intra-action model.

                    <p class="text-dec">The literature research on the origin of today’s notion of aging indicates that
                        our common understanding of aging is far from an objective concept but heavily influenced by
                        early medical findings, problematized by societal and governmental administrations, and fixated
                        by cultural stereotypes. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp"> Three pitfalls were
                            summarized after analysis of current mainstream gerontechnology, which are ignorance of
                            aging people’s needs, misunderstanding of aging people’s needs credited to medicalized and
                            simplified view of aging, and over-emphasis on aging people’s needs distorted by the
                            problematized view of aging.</span> Interviews conducted with older participants (N=5)
                        confirmed the findings from the literature research and generalized <span
                            class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">the characteristics of the aging process which is
                            developmental, multi-faceted, dynamic, complex, and personal.</span> It is in sharp contrast
                        with mainstream gerontechnology which is rigid, over-medicalized, one-size-fits-all,
                        stigmatized, or tech-oriented. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This boils down to

                    <p class="text-dec">In recent years, the concept of performativity has influenced the design field.
                        The performative approach prompts a relational view toward the interaction between humans and
                        technological objects. The performative discourse later converges into several practical design
                        proposals that embrace and encourage the continuous co-constituting entanglement relationship
                        between humans and technological objects. This line focuses on concepts such as appropriation,

                                Capability Theory</span><br> The capability approach (CA) pioneered by Martha Nussbaum
                            and
                            Amartya Sen, has become an influential framework for reflecting on justice, equality,
                            well-being, and development (Oosterlaken 2013, p.41). The difference between the capability
                            approach and capability theory should be noted here. As explained by Robeyns (2017, p.29),
                            the capability approach is an “open-ended and underspecified framework, which can be used
                            for multiple purposes” and there are various ways to “close” it. When the capability
                            approach is specified for a specific use, it is proposed to be called a capability theory.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-dec"><span class="ht3"> CA and Well-being</span><br>
                            Informed by the personhood turn described in the previous chapter, we see the importance of
                            taking a holistic approach while addressing the well-being of older people. However,
                            concepts like well-being or quality of life are never easy to define. Oosterlaken (2013)
                            proposes that human capabilities can be seen as the implicit or ‘missing link’ between more
                            comprehensive ideas of the good life and concrete technical artifacts. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Therefore, the CA offers a proper way to assess
                                people’s well-being in terms of capabilities. Nussbaum’s capability theory provides a
                                concrete and substantive normative foundation (Jacobs 2020) for probing into older
                                people’s lived experiences and well-being.</span>
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote reveal_X">CA is generally understood as a conceptual framework for a range of
                            normative exercises, including most prominent the following: (1) the assessment of
                            individual well-being; (2) the evaluation and assessment of social arrangements; and (3) the
                            design of policies and proposals about social change in society. (Robeyns, 2011)</p>

                            On understanding the relation between technological artifacts and human capabilities,
                            Oosterlaken (2013) posited that moving back and forth between ‘zooming in’ and ‘zooming out’
                            is required: while the former ‘allows us to see the specific features or design details of
                            technical artifacts’, the latter ‘allows us to see how exactly technical artifacts are
                            embedded in broader socio-technical networks and practices’. From the perspective of CA,

                            The participants were asked to read and sign the informed consent. After that, the
                            interviewer briefly introduced the background of the project and let the participant ask
                            questions they have before officially starting. The permission of recording was then
                            requested. <br>

                            <strong>First activity (Warm-up)</strong><br>

                            The participant was asked to describe what a typical day in his or her life looks like in
                            the form of a timeline.<br>

                            <strong>Second activity</strong><br>

                            The participant was provided with a set of cards with a topic and several guiding questions
                            revolving around that topic. There were twelve cards in total and they were presented to the
                            participant in three rounds (each round with four cards). The participant was asked to
                            choose the topic he or she feels like sharing and was not requested to cover all topics.
                            Only one additional topic related to technology (the black card) was a compulsory one, which
                            lets them share their feelings about the digital products they use currently.<br>

                            <strong>Third activity</strong><br>

                            The participant was shown a diagram of a human body, in which some common devices or
                            accessories related to different body parts were listed. A list of digital functions was
                            provided on another sheet of paper. The participant was asked to associate one or several
                            functions with the device or accessory that was most desired to be endowed with extra
                            functions, namely, to be ‘smartified’. Participants can choose more than one device and
                            share their thoughts on how they would like to use the ‘smartified’ devices (in what kind of
                            situation).<br>

                            <strong>Gift</strong><br>

                            In the end, the participant was given a self-printed postcard as a gift and was invited to
                            attend a follow-up session in the future.

                            were taken all the way along the coding process to extract meaning from the data, document
                            the coder’s emerging thoughts and doubts, and open later discussions (Birks, Chapman, &

                                vary from person to person.</p>

                        <p class="text">Our society abounds with misconceptions about aging at odds with reality. This,
                            in turn, opens up the opportunity space for designers to rethink the notion of aging to
                            better design technological systems. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The
                                nuanced dynamics, diversity, and complexity of aging should be taken into account and
                                the focus should not only be on the deficits but also on the capability of older
                                people.</span>

                        <p class="text-dec"><span class="ht3"> Probing Toolkit</span><br> The probing toolkit designed
                            by the investigator worked well to engage the participants and make the interview more
                            dynamic and interesting. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The abstraction of
                                the topics extracted from the capability theory
                                was concretized by the guiding questions.</span> The freedom of choosing the topics to
                            talk about
                            alleviated the pressure of sharing personal life. Overall, the card set served as a good
                            conversation starter to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the life of the
                            participants.<br>
                            The human body diagram and the function list worked well to generate interest and stimulate
                            the imagination of the participants. Many of the participants actively speculated on the
                            possible products in the future by associating the function and the device.

                        <p class="text-dec"><span class="ht3"> Data Analysis Methods</span><br>The investigator
                            deliberately chose the methods of analysis to identify patterns as well as extract the
                            richness of lived experiences. Therefore, hybrid coding methods were used. Furthermore,
                            besides using the usual methods of thematic analysis by clustering to surface patterns,
                            nuances in the data were kept in the vignette writing. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The general insights gleaned from the
                                interviews were documented as the result of a holistic analysis. The combination of
                                different methods in analysis contributes to remaining the richness of data and serves
                                as a
                                solid step toward the framing phase.</span>
                        </p>


                        <p class="text-dec"><span class="ht3">Limitation of Sampling</span><br>The main limitation of
                            this study was the language. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">As the interviews
                                can only be conducted in English, this might
                                already filter out a certain part of the target group.</span> For example, the Dutch
                            participants
                            must be literate enough to speak English which means aging people who are not that literate
                            might not be represented by this sample. And the expression of the participants might be
                            limited by using a language that’s not their mother tongue. Besides, the recruiting of the
                            participants was through a personal network and two out of five participants work in the
                            creative industry and are still actively working, which might not be congruent with the
                            usual situations of retirement.

            <p class="text"><strong>Make a gradual optimization plan</strong> Drastic changes in design always risk
                causing issues of adaption. If we had more time, we will design a
                fine-grained optimization plan to gradually roll out the new features and diminish the backlash of
                the
                new design.</p>

            <p class="text"><strong>Take technical constraints into account</strong> When we proposed to use the
                physical button for quicker timing, our client favored this idea and
                encouraged us to go for it. However, this feature probably needs to run on a standalone application
                rather than a web-based service. This would bring up further discussion around the tradeoff between
                making an application or still keeping it a web-based service.</p>

                undeliberate.
                We have been through three big or small iterations throughout this project, and we attempted to make
