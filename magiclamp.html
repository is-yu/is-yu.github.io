            <p class="text"> Starting with research into the notion of aging and the state-of-art of mainstream
                gerontechnology. I sought to challenge the current common understanding of aging and identified the
                pitfalls of mainstream gerontechnology up to date.<br>

                <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This surfaced the first tension: the mismatch between the
                    needs of the aging process and what technology
                    provides.</span> To address this tension, I proposed ‘design for openness’ as a potential design
                strategy and
                theorized an intra-action model.<br>

                Based on this model, I conducted co-speculation sessions with older participants which <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">revealed the
                    potential risks of leaving design completely open, that is the second tension, the ineffective
                    appropriation caused by a misalignment between use and design.</span><br>

                To address the misalignment, I further explored by making a concept artifact. Evaluation of the artifact
                offered rich design implications and drove the development of the intra-action model.

                    <p class="text-dec">The literature research on the origin of today’s notion of aging indicates that
                        our common understanding of aging is far from an objective concept but heavily influenced by
                        early medical findings, problematized by societal and governmental administrations, and fixated
                        by cultural stereotypes. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp"> Three pitfalls were
                            summarized after analysis of current mainstream gerontechnology, which are ignorance of
                            aging people’s needs, misunderstanding of aging people’s needs credited to medicalized and
                            simplified view of aging, and over-emphasis on aging people’s needs distorted by the
                            problematized view of aging.</span> Interviews conducted with older participants (N=5)
                        confirmed the findings from the literature research and generalized <span
                            class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">the characteristics of the aging process which is
                            developmental, multi-faceted, dynamic, complex, and personal.</span> It is in sharp contrast
                        with mainstream gerontechnology which is rigid, over-medicalized, one-size-fits-all,
                        stigmatized, or tech-oriented. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This boils down to
                            the mismatch between the needs in the aging process and what’s provided by current

                    <p class="text-dec">In recent years, the concept of performativity has influenced the design field.
                        The performative approach prompts a relational view toward the interaction between humans and
                        technological objects. The performative discourse later converges into several practical design
                        proposals that embrace and encourage the continuous co-constituting entanglement relationship
                        between humans and technological objects. This line focuses on concepts such as appropriation,
                        ambiguity in design, meta-design, end-user development, and so on. <span
                            class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Inspired by those design theories, I proposed a
                            potential design strategy named ‘design for openness’ which can bring the advantages of
                            situatedness, dynamics, and autonomy.</span> </p>

                        After analysis, the root cause of ineffective appropriation was identified to be the

                                Capability Theory</span><br> The capability approach (CA) pioneered by Martha Nussbaum
                            and
                            Amartya Sen, has become an influential framework for reflecting on justice, equality,
                            well-being, and development (Oosterlaken 2013, p.41). The difference between the capability
                            approach and capability theory should be noted here. As explained by Robeyns (2017, p.29),
                            the capability approach is an “open-ended and underspecified framework, which can be used
                            for multiple purposes” and there are various ways to “close” it. When the capability
                            approach is specified for a specific use, it is proposed to be called a capability theory.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-dec"><span class="ht3"> CA and Well-being</span><br>
                            Informed by the personhood turn described in the previous chapter, we see the importance of
                            taking a holistic approach while addressing the well-being of older people. However,
                            concepts like well-being or quality of life are never easy to define. Oosterlaken (2013)
                            proposes that human capabilities can be seen as the implicit or ‘missing link’ between more
                            comprehensive ideas of the good life and concrete technical artifacts. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Therefore, the CA offers a proper way to assess
                                people’s well-being in terms of capabilities. Nussbaum’s capability theory provides a
                                concrete and substantive normative foundation (Jacobs 2020) for probing into older
                                people’s lived experiences and well-being.</span>
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote reveal_X">CA is generally understood as a conceptual framework for a range of
                            normative exercises, including most prominent the following: (1) the assessment of
                            individual well-being; (2) the evaluation and assessment of social arrangements; and (3) the
                            design of policies and proposals about social change in society. (Robeyns, 2011)</p>

                            Oosterlaken (2013) posited that moving back and forth between ‘zooming in’ and ‘zooming out’
                            is required: while the former ‘allows us to see the specific features or design details of
                            technical artifacts’, the latter ‘allows us to see how exactly technical artifacts are
                            embedded in broader socio-technical networks and practices’. From the perspective of CA,

                            The participants were asked to read and sign the informed consent. After that, the
                            interviewer briefly introduced the background of the project and let the participant ask
                            questions they have before officially starting. The permission of recording was then
                            requested. <br>

                            <strong>First activity (Warm-up)</strong><br>

                            The participant was asked to describe what a typical day in his or her life looks like in
                            the form of a timeline.<br>

                            <strong>Second activity</strong><br>

                            The participant was provided with a set of cards with a topic and several guiding questions
                            revolving around that topic. There were twelve cards in total and they were presented to the
                            participant in three rounds (each round with four cards). The participant was asked to
                            choose the topic he or she feels like sharing and was not requested to cover all topics.
                            Only one additional topic related to technology (the black card) was a compulsory one, which
                            lets them share their feelings about the digital products they use currently.<br>

                            <strong>Third activity</strong><br>

                            The participant was shown a diagram of a human body, in which some common devices or
                            accessories related to different body parts were listed. A list of digital functions was
                            provided on another sheet of paper. The participant was asked to associate one or several
                            functions with the device or accessory that was most desired to be endowed with extra
                            functions, namely, to be ‘smartified’. Participants can choose more than one device and
                            share their thoughts on how they would like to use the ‘smartified’ devices (in what kind of
                            situation).<br>

                            In the end, the participant was given a self-printed postcard as a gift and was invited to
                            attend a follow-up session in the future.

                            started with priori codes based on the nine selected central capabilities. The used ways of
                            inductive coding include in vivo coding, process coding (observations of non-verbal
                            communications), structural coding (based on demographic attributes including profession,
                            interests, etc.), and values coding.

                            were taken all the way along the coding process to extract meaning from the data, document
                            the coder’s emerging thoughts and doubts, and open later discussions (Birks, Chapman, &

                                Many of the participants showed a great capability of adapting to the shrinkage of
                                certain capabilities, for instance, the declining physical conditions, by focusing on
                                what they still can do. The well-being paradox, where older persons experience high
                                levels of well-being regardless of age-related declines, confirms that physical frailty
                                does not definitely negatively influence the perceived quality of life while
                                psychological factors contribute most (Vanleerberghe et al., 2019). This also indicates
                                that despite a similar process of physical declination, the attitudes towards it might
                                vary from person to person.</p>

                            limited by using a language that’s not their mother tongue. Besides, the recruiting of the
                            participants was through a personal network and two out of five participants work in the
                            creative industry and are still actively working, which might not be congruent with the

                                    The whole system is based on an if-this-then-that (IFTTT) rule. The tangible part of
                                    this PSS provides the pre-set gestures or passively sensed information as the input.
                                    The tangible product in this concept is an artificial limb - one extra finger that
                                    can be worn like a ring. The simulated biological form is intended to trigger a
                                    natural association of use like a finger. The movements or gestures could therefore
                                    be captured and recorded. The actively created gestures (e.g. tapping a surface)
                                    will be put in a library and serves as a set of triggers for certain functions.
                                    Embedded sensors - a micro camera - work as a life recorder and can be reconfigured
                                    as the input of certain functions. All data can be transmitted to a smart device
                                    installed with the application. Basic motor components - a vibrator and an LED - are

                            Taking the form of everyday objects, the Able Lifekit is easy to adopt at the first glance.
                            As many everyday objects are used in various daily activities, the extra-ordinary
                            functionalities can be triggered to use in different contexts. <span

                                context.</span> While each one of the products in the kit can function separately, the
                            interconnectivity among those products enables possible use in combination. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The downside of this concept is that the
                                familiar form of the thing - not an object anymore because it is embedded in a network -
                                risks being so directional that it obstructs the exploration of ‘unusual’ ways of

            <p class="text">Explorations around design features led me to the direction of ‘design for openness’. Design
                for openness is a design approach that draws upon various design theories or frameworks including
                appropriation, open to interpretation, ambiguity in design, meta-design, and so on. Actually, there are
                many similar other theories or paradigms that have inspired this project including non-finito products
                (Seok et al., 2014), bricolage (Lanzara, 1999), and so on. Due to the limited space, I won’t elaborate
                on all of them but mainly focus on the following four.</p>

                        <div class="text">What makes ordinary objects magical? David L. Rose (2014) at MIT Media Lab
                            coined the word enchanted objects in his book Enchanted objects: Design, human desire, and
                            the Internet of things. Disappointed by the fact that so many products are ‘difficult to
                            understand, frustrating to use, overwrought with features’, he attempted to ‘develop
                            products that are engaging and essential, resonating with the latent needs of those who use
                            them, and that creates an emotional connection with us human beings. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Along this line, magic can be understood as the
                                product's ability to answer humans’ fundamental drives and bring an engaging experience
                                perfectly.</span> In this project, we use Nussbaum’s capability theory to define the

                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">the word magic lays stress on the fulfillment of
                                persistent human needs and desires - magic emerges when the needs and artifacts are

                                theories (Karen Barad 2007), I borrowed the term intra-action to describe the
                                continuous process of co-constitution between humans and machines.</span> It is
                            different from interaction by defining the primary ontological unit of reality as phenomena
                            that include both people and things. The term intra-action strikes the bidirectional nature
                            - it is not only us shaping smart things but also being shaped by them as well.
                            As Frauenberger (2021) pointed out, 'Taking a relational ontology perspective offers to
                            describe our relationships with smart things as a process of defining and continuously
                            redefining us and the smart thing through our intra-action. This reorientates designing
                            smart things from the magic-like tool towards an actor with intent that needs to be open to
                            negotiate its relationship in a wider network of use.'</div>

                            while Emily was away on vacation so not being able to do so. The first interview provided a
                            good opportunity to get to know the participants personally and laid the foundation for this
                            session.

                        <p class="text-dec"><span class="ht3"> Procedure</span><br>The co-speculation session was
                            conducted one-on-one at the same place as where the interview did: three were in the
                            participants’ places and one was at the cafe. Table 4 showed detailed information about the
                            sessions. The sessions lasted about 90 minutes.<br>
                            <strong>Opening</strong><br>
                            The participants were asked to give permission for audio recording. After that, the
                            facilitator briefly introduced the main activities of the session and let the participant
                            ask questions they have before officially starting. <br>

                            <strong>First activity (Warm-up)</strong><br>
                            The session started with a five-minute-body scan guided by pre-recorded voice guidance on
                            Calm. Calm is a popular application for meditation and sleep. The body scan was aimed at
                            tuning into the body—to reconnect to the physical self—and notice any sensations you're
                            feeling without judgment.<br>

                            <strong>Second activity</strong><br>
                            The participants were asked to play with provided objects freely. To encourage them to
                            interact with the objects through the body, two heuristic questions were asked: (1) Can you
                            wear/put it on different parts of your body? (2) How can you interact with it? Participants
                            were encouraged to think of natural ways of embodied interactions and then come up with
                            unfamiliar ways.<br>

                            <strong>Third activity</strong><br>
                            After exploring the objects for a while, the participants were introduced to a set of
                            digital functions by the facilitator. Given that most aging people might not be familiar
                            with digital functions, the functions were briefly explained. They serve as the inspiration
                            pool that the participant could use for the later association.<br>
                            The participants were asked to think of some activities they valued in their life. Activity
                            cards created by the investigator were provided as inspirations. Starting with unpacking the
                            sequential scenes in the activity, the participants were prompted to think of how to
                            associate certain functions with the provided objects to support the activity. The
                            speculation ended with the enactment of the scenario with the object. Two to three rounds of
                            speculation were conducted until the end of the session.<br>

                            <strong>Ending</strong><br>
                            The sessions were closed with appreciation expressed by the investigator. Further questions
                            from the participants were answered after finishing.

                        <p class="text">It was noticed that when asked to play with the provided objects and explore
                            with their bodies, the participants were difficult to quickly think of different bodily
                            movements. That meant the objects were only able to elicit limited bodily movements. One
                            reason might be that the most intuitive and natural bodily movements elicited by the object
                            are limited (e.g. Stretch the elastic band, Thread through the beads). When encouraged to
                            explore unfamiliar ways of interaction, some participants might even feel awkward.</p>
                        <p class="text">This means that It is not an inborn ability to generate rich body language. We
                            can also say everybody has different levels of somaesthetic literacy. Professional dancers
                            probably have a larger bodily vocabulary than average people, let alone aging people who
                            might face a decline in motor skills.</p>
                        <p class="text"><span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Though the elicitation of bodily
                                movements is harder than expected, another type of association was quite remarkable,
                                which is the association of doings including related practices and situated
                                actions.</span> Another noteworthy type of association was attaching cultural or
                            metaphoric meanings to the object. For example, Anna associated the sticker sticking beneath
                            the desk legs or chair legs to prevent scratching with the environmental orderliness and
                            inner tranquility. Robert associated the lens with observation and discovery. </p>

                            provided. The task to associate certain digital functions with the provided objects they
                            previously explored was quite difficult. The effect of the first exploring activity being
                            used as the input to pair objects with functions was limited. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This implied that drawing connections between
                                the physical affordances and digital functions do not make much sense.</span> One
                            possible reason is that when requested to pair the object and the digital functions from
                            scratch, too many options lead to difficulty in meaningful pairing. This also indicated that
                            the DIY rule configuration in the first concept does not suit them - the operation is too
                            complex to use.</p>

                            needed to support the activities they valued, many participants got stuck. One possible
                            reason is that the overwhelming information was hard to process. <span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Besides, more importantly, this implies that
                                the emergence of needs takes time.</span> Because of the limited time of the
                            session, the whole session is arranged to simulate the process of appropriating
                            ambiguous objects in everyday settings instead of the real one. However, it’s apparently
                            hard to condense the process which might take weeks or even months into a 90-minute
                            session. Creative use of ambiguous objects can only be triggered by genuine needs or
                            being revealed to serendipitous functions.</p>

                            with older people were not plain sailing. The different personalities of older people make
                            the facilitation of each session a new adventure. For example, some participants are more
                            talkative and diverging and necessary interventions are needed to steer the direction of
                            diverging. Some participants are more thoughtful and better at abstract thinking, some
                            guidance toward concretized speculation is needed. Overall, it was a great pleasure to
                            co-speculate and discuss with a variety of people. The discussion sometimes went
                            surprisingly deeper than expected. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The outcome
                                of the sessions was full of surprises and effectively exposed the blind spots the
                                investigator had. Besides, topics on autonomy and agency, chronological evolution of
                                use, technology-utopian, etc. were touched upon during the sessions, which were quite
                                inspiring and brought much intellectual pleasure.</span>
                            <br>
                            <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">One recurring pattern in the sessions with the
                                older people was that they would be positive about the value of gerontechnology, but
                                then hurry to add that they themselves would not need something like that yet (i.e. it
                                was useful for other older people, with more health issues).</span> This might be partly
                            true in this case, because many of the participants are in good condition. But sometimes, it
                            might be that participants don’t feel comfortable talking about their own issues openly.
                            This can be an obstacle in co-speculation if they were asked to ideate solutions for
                            themselves. Hence, <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">situated elderliness was
                                used to detach the participants from their own experiences. Activity cards were used as
                                provided situations that are not necessary to be their own experience.</span> In this
                            way, participants will have no scruple to brainstorm and co-speculate.

                encountered during the speculation process indicated that <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">the configuration of physical affordances and digital
                    functions is arbitrary and complex. This revealed the potential risk of leaving the design
                    completely open.</span></p>
            <div class="ht3">Ineffective Appropriation</div>
            <p class="text"><span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The cause of ineffective appropriation is
                    rooted in the misalignment between design and use. </span>That means the actual use of the design is
                different from the designers' expectations.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="quote">But wait, isn't the whole point of design for openness to encourage and accommodate the
                possible different ways of use? Now, why should we be concerned about the actual ways of use being
                different from what's expected?</p>

            <p class="text">Indeed, the core of design for openness is to
                leave the design open to various ways of use. However, <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">what I proposed to avoid here is ineffective ways of use
                    which includes inefficient use or failure of adoption.</span></p>

                    <div class="text">For example, of course, you can use a piece of paper to cut things by using the
                        sharp edge, but it's far from efficient ways of use like folding it into a container to collect
                        paper clips.</div>

                <div class="column-child-2 border-left">
                    <div class="para-title">Failure of Adoption</div>
                    <div class="text">For example, a piece of broken glass can be made into various products including
                        glasses, magnifiers, camera lenses, etc., but it’s too raw a material to be easily appropriated.
                        Similarly, the separate physical affordances and digital functions might be too primitive to be
                        quickly combined and appropriated. </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="quote">The more open the design is, the more raw or primitive it will be, and there will be more
                possible ways of use but the higher the threshold of use will be.</p>

            <p class="text">Therefore, instead of leaving the design completely open, openness should be carefully
                calibrated to improve use effectiveness and efficiency. So, <span

                            participants who attended the second round of sessions were invited to this last round of
                            sessions. For a design that has been intentionally made open to various interpretations and
                            purposes of use, it is important to gather and incorporate a variety of assessments from a
                            diverse population of interpreters, allowing outsiders to get a rich and layered view of how
                            the system is used, the roles it plays, and the cultural implications it suggests (Sengers &
                            Gaver, 2006). Hence, four young designers were invited as external evaluators to provide a
                            more objective viewpoint. The demographics of the newly recruited participants were listed
                            in the chart below. All names have been changed for privacy considerations.

                            First, three still images were shown to the participant, and he/she was asked to express
                            his/her feelings or preferences towards each style. Then the participants were asked to make
                            associations or wild guesses about the object they see based on their own assumptions. <br>

                            <strong>Activity 2</strong><br>
                            A demo video demonstrating how the object works were played for the participant. Then the
                            participant was asked to explain how the object works according to their understanding. The
                            misunderstanding was corrected if there was any. Then the participants were prompted to talk
                            about how it might be used to support them by describing different situations coming into
                            their minds.<br>

                            <strong>Activity 3</strong><br>
                            Interfaces of the application connected with the object were presented and introduced to the
                            participant. Questions about the functions were clarified if there were any. Then the
                            participants were prompted to think of new situations of use.<br>

                            <strong>Closing</strong><br>
                            After showing all features, the participants were encouraged to share concerns or extra
                            thoughts and feelings about the design.

                            the project background while the four designers knew nothing about this project in the

                    high-level properties and how people react to certain factors can be quite similar. This leads to an
                    expansion of the original component (physical affordances) to high-level properties.</span> In this
                sense, it is suggested that designers should pay more attention to the associations people usually draw
                or other responses people usually have thereby moving one step closer to the use perspective. </p>

            <p class="ht3">Beyond Physical Affordances</p>
            <p class="text">With the expansion of physical affordances, <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">I
                    found that the relation between the two originally separate components (physical affordances and
                    digital functions) is no longer separate but intertwined. Because during the long course of use, the
                    digital functions can be internalized as part of the high-level properties.</span> For example, when
                people are familiar with the timing property of the oven, they can also jump out of the most closely
                associated use scenarios like cooking but use it to time for anything they want. This is also crucial to
                inventing extraordinary ways of use. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Therefore, the task
                    for designers boils down to distributing the percentage of familiarity and unfamiliarity.</span></p>

            </div>
            <p class="text"><span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This suggests a changing model in different
                    stages of use.</span> In the adoption phase, the familiarity is mostly provided by the physical
                properties and the unfamiliarity is from the abstract digital functions. <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Over the course of use, the digital functions will become
                    more and more familiar to users and be internalized as part of the high-level properties and the two
                    original components will draw closer and begin to merge.</span> This is a dynamic process of the
                post-adoption phase.</p>

            <p class="ht3">Conversion Factors</p>
            <p class="text">The third component in the model —- desired capabilities —- can be seen as the final outcome
                of the tension between the familiar part and the unfamiliar part. The overlapping area which the
                familiar and the unfamiliar direct toward can be represented by what capabilities can be achieved.
                Besides, in order to truly transform the assets provided by the technological objects into capabilities,
                the conversion factors should be taken into account. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This
                    prompts the design that reflects respect for human skills at various levels including motor-sensory
                    skills, cognitive skills, social skills, and so on.</span> </p>

            <p class="ht3">Alternative Design Process</p>
            <p class="text">The following design process is an attempt to provide a systematic design guideline to
                strategically steer the process of design for openness. The biggest difference between this design
                process and the traditional one is the focal point. <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Usually,
                    the design process starts from one or several
                    pre-defined tasks or goals to be achieved by the users and the whole process is centered around
                    helping users to complete their tasks or achieve their goals. However, in the alternative design
                    process, the starting point is the meaningful associations established between humans and the
                    properties of objects.</span></p>
            <div class="one-column img-wrapper-landscape reveal_y_delay"

                <img src="/asset/magiclamp/1.4-alternative design process.png" alt="framework" class="one-column-img">
            </div>
            <p class="text"><span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">Since the design process aims at creating a
                    purposefully purposeless design, the risk of losing meaningful purposes of use should be kept in
                    mind.</span> How to decide what digital functions should be added? How to make sure the combination
                makes sense to users? Besides, <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">we should also be wary of
                    ‘overdesign’ by using this strategy.</span> Is it necessary to add digital functions? How much added
                value is created?

                Additionally, <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">identifying the boundary of the use scope
                    ensures the appropriate use of any design strategy.</span> Apparently, openness in design is not
                suitable in the context where the problem to be solved or the task to be achieved is clearly defined.
                Instead of putting the efficiency of getting things done in the first place, design for openness prompts
                a playful way to engage humans. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">It works well in the
                    following design contexts: (1) to overturn implicit stereotypes; (2) to break design fixation; (3)
                    ludic design (Gaver et al., 2003).</span></p>

            <p class="text"><strong>More evaluations conducted in the real life should be conducted.</strong> <br>For
                now, the evaluation of the concept artifact was conducted in vitro instead of in vivo due to the limited
                time and the lack of technology support. In the ideal situation, the evaluation should be done with
                workable prototypes and users should experience the whole process from adoption to post-adoption. <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">The long-term observation of the spontaneous developing
                    process during which users generate different ways of use in their daily lives will definitely bring
                    more insights into the use of the design strategy in the real life.</span> </p>

            <p class="text"><strong>A double-blind experiment can be done with professional designers to evaluate the
                    effectiveness of the design strategy.</strong><br> For now, how effective the design strategy can
                break design stereotypes or design fixation remains unclear. Third, the proposed alternative design
                process presents a way to move beyond the traditional design process. Current design practice mainly
                focuses on things like usability and user satisfaction. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">
                    Shifting the focus of design from problem-solving to human responses opens up an exciting
                    opportunity space for the future development of the design field.</span></p>

            <p class="ht2">What I have learned ... </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Theories and design can go hand-in-hand but it requires technique</strong><br> The
                project was the first trial for me to approach framework theorizing and artifact crafting in parallel.
                The initial two design concepts helped surface the initial theoretical idea. The following
                co-speculation session was used as an essential source of input to further develop the theoretical idea.
                In combination with other theories, the concept became more clear and is further refined in the form of
                the concept artifact. <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">This approach is jointly informed by
                    theoretical and designerly knowledge and competencies.</span> This project has just been through the
                first endeavor in the embodiment of theoretical arguments but it already exemplified the huge potential
                to take a designerly approach to do research. </p>

            <p class="text"><strong>Asking the right question is crucial to approaching an undefined
                    problem</strong><br>Looking back, I was amazed by the path I took in this project and how everything
                I did in the past few months came together and consisted of the narrative I presented in this report.
                <span class="s-highlight highlight-magiclamp">If I need to say just one thing that I learned in such a
                    complex and open-ended project, I would say how to formulate research questions to guide the
                    research activities.</span> To be honest, some of the research questions were articulated verbally
                in hindsight, but each turn of the research direction has
                been guided by an unanswered question stringing together the whole journey of
                exploration.<br>
                The constructive explorative journey I experienced in this project required me clinging to the original
                goals and swiftly framing and
                reframing the research question based on intermediate findings. It is not easy to maintain a
                clear direction in research in the chaotic explorative process. I learned to frequently return to the
                research questions or
                just by asking myself what research question I want to answer to navigate through the complexity of
                this project and continuously push the research forward.
