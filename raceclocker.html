            <p class="text reveal_y">We were given the task to improve the user experience of RaceClocker. As our
                client, Cees
                van Dok (the founder of RaceClocker) <span class="s-highlight highlight-raceclocker">mainly saw this
                    project as a source of inspiration for future
                    iterations, the technical constraints were lifted and bold concepts were encouraged.</span> </p>
            <p class="text reveal_y">Of course, if I were optimizing the real product,
                I would also consider the
                negative
                influence brought by the changes on the product (e.g. confusion caused by drastic changes in the new
                design) and take technical feasibility into account. I would also refer back to the company’s
                roadmap,
                to think about whether the new design is necessary for both its users and the business. Now
                that the aim
                is for envisioning the product in the most ideal state, we, therefore, left off those concerns and went
                for the best at full force.</p>

                            RaceClocker is a Software as a Service (SaaS) - also known as cloud-based
                            software. Instead of installing and maintaining software, users access it via the
                            internet. Besides, it uses a cloud service to store and transfer time tracked data.</p>
                        <p class="text"> <strong>Extended products</strong><br>
                            A 7 minutes instruction video on the RaceClocker homepage explains all the
                            functions available.</p>
                        <p class="text"><strong>Symbiotic products</strong><br>
                            An internet connection is necessary when using this product. It enables
                            the transfer of real-time data. Since RaceClocker is a web-browser based
                            product, it can be used on multiple devices with an internet connection, such
                            as smartphone, tablet and laptop. A CSV based file of the participants list will
                            be helpful when the race manager wants to upload the participants list into
                            RaceClocker. Beside, a subscription is needed if users want to have more access
                            to functions and organize a race with more than 10 participants. Sometimes,
                            an external display is used for showing the countdown start time for sporters
                            and sharing the live results with the audience. Since RaceClocker doesn’t include
                            chips, bib or bow number labels are a way to recognise participants.
                            A bib number is also known as competition number, it is printed on a label which
                            can be attached to the participants’ clothes or gear.</p>

                            a rowing race process.
                            Two rowing races from DDS, a
                            rowing association in Delft, were
                            observed. One of us experienced the

                            using RaceClocker in a real scenario.
                            There were three starting laps of 10
                            participants, varying from single to

                            As mentioned in previous chapters,
                            RaceClocker is a manual timing tool
                            which can be used for several types of
                            sports races. RaceClocker is offered in
                            the form of a website and can be used
                            on several devices, such as laptops,
                            tablets and smartphones. The main
                            purpose of RaceClocker is to allow
                            small scale race events for fast and
                            easy manual timing.</p>
                        <p class="text"> <span class="s-highlight highlight-raceclocker">Within the use of RaceClocker
                                we acknowledge two main phases. </span><br><span
                                class="s-highlight highlight-raceclocker">The first phase
                                includes the race preparation, in which a race manager enters all of the race
                                details relevant within the race by creating the race on a laptop.</span> Such as, the
                            location, date and time, sport type, but also a participant list and details. After
                            that, links to the timers will be shared with time keepers, to enable them to keep
                            track of time during the race. <br><span class="s-highlight highlight-raceclocker">The
                                second phase is the actual race, here we know
                                direct users and indirect users.</span> The race manager is, in most cases, present at
                            the
                            start of the race. Using a laptop, the race manager is able to keep an overview of
                            the race. The timer dashboard gives the race manager the ability to see to which
                            participants a time has been assigned. Timekeepers are the ones in the field, who
                            assign times to the racers possible in different timing settings. Finally the race
                            manager is able to share an overview of live results, if needed on a large screen,
                            in order to make sure that racers and audience can view results live and directly
                            during and after the race.</p>
