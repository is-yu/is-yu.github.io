            <p class="text">We decided to use the scrum method to control our work progress in the upfront of this
                project. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">We had a sprint planning meeting every Friday
                    afternoon in which we wrote down everything in
                    our mind that probably needed to be done in the ‘backlog’,</span> such as SWOT analysis and
                stakeholder
                analysis. Then we started our ‘sprint’. Every one of us was assigned several ‘backlogs’ to finish by the
                next Friday. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">During the week, we did 1-2 weekly ‘standup(s)’ to
                    exchange our progress and help each
                    other out.</span> And finally, it turns out to be efficient to work in this way. We had a quite nice
                time
                management and task division. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">It not only allowed us to
                    leverage our strengths to the greatest extent
                    but also gave us opportunities to challenge ourselves to practice outside our ‘comfort

            <p class="text">We conducted the cruise market study and investigated SITA’s current systems and processes,
                which provided us with a deep understanding of the context. We also analyzed different stakeholders of
                the supply chain, identified the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (TOWS analysis) of
                SITA as a service provider, and considered the different competitive forces that control the market
                dynamics (Porter’s Five Forces). <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The findings were complemented
                    with empirical data from user research

                    and
                    guide the new supplier relationships strategy</span>. Further, investigating the current
                processes and systems and customers and journeys provides an understanding of the different
                socio-technical aspects that must be considered in the design.

            <p class="text">The airport’s luggage handling system has an essential role in keeping passengers pleased,
                which is a critical component in the ability of an airport to attract or retain a significant airline
                hub (Nice, 2001). SITA is the world’s leading specialist in air transport communications and information
                technology. Currently, SITA is serving 95% of international destinations, including collaboration with
                over 2.500 airlines, airports, ground handlers, and governments (SITA, 2021). This means that SITA's

            <p class="ht3" id="stakeholder-c">Stakeholder analysis</p>
            <p class="text">A stakeholder analysis was conducted to map out various relevant actors and understand them
                better. Relative stakeholders are plotted in a power/interest grid. Two things are noteworthy here. <br>

                Firstly, transfer agencies are added to the grid twice. The one in quadrant B is a one-to-one
                relationship with SITA, which means there is a single big company with which SITA has a partnership. The
                one in quadrant D is a one-to-many relationship, which means multiple smaller transfer agencies are in
                contract with SITA. The pros and cons of these relationships will be discussed later in the supplier
                relationship.<br>

                Secondly, consumers (quadrant D) are the end-users of all stakeholders in quadrant B except for SITA.
                All actors ultimately will try to provide value for their end-users to gain long-term benefits
                themselves. SITA’s main customers/clients are mainly toB (e.g. airlines) and these clients have the
                customers whom they provide services for.</p>

            <p class="text border-left">The global cruise ship market is dominated by three key parent companies which
                include Carnival, Royal Caribbean International (RCI), and Norwegian. Carnival possesses the highest
                market share at 37.1 %. Other smaller cruise lines possess a significant market share of 29.2%.</p>
            <p class="text border-left">The number of passengers grew by almost 60% between 2009 and 2019, until the
                pandemic resulted in a steep drop. The prospects for the cruise industry, however, seem optimistic as
                the economies emerge out of the pandemic, which can be validated by the two-fold increase in the number
                of passengers between 2020 and 2021.</p>
            <p class="text border-left">Europe is the second largest passenger source with 3.5 million passengers. The
                passenger source can be further drilled down to Germany: 1,068,900, France: 374,100, and Benelux:
                97,900.</p>
            <p class="text border-left">Most cruises in Amsterdam port operate between May and October representing a
                predictable seasonal trend.</p>

                    systems which will provide more value to passengers. Brand reputation and business expertise can be

                    relationship, the actors are not deeply invested in each other, and the switching cost is low.
                    Therefore the purchasing risk is low. SITA may work with several delivery service providers to
                    arrange ad-hoc services in the given context.</div>
                <div class="caption-dec column-child-2" style="text-align:start;"><strong>Strategic collaborative
                        relationships:</strong>
                    The buyer and supplier develop a partnership built on long-term contracts, fair agreements, and
                    collaborative support. While the risks involved are high, they are often shared, and strategic
                    interfirm collaboration results in higher responsiveness and superior performance of the supply
                    network (Kim & Lee, 2010). Strategic collaboration also facilitates inter-system communication
                    between SITA systems and delivery service providers. This can be instrumental in ensuring bags are
                    tracked, traced, and accounted for during the transfer process.</div>
                <p class="text">The analysis shows that the benefits of a strategic collaborative relationship outweigh
                    the routine transaction relationship in this case. Further insights from market data emphasize a
                    predictable passenger influx that does not require an ad-hoc service. Therefore, <span
                        class="s-highlight highlight-sita">we recommend strategic collaboration as the preferred
                        relationship model between SITA and the delivery service providers, which fosters reliability,
                        resilience, and service excellence</span>.</p>

            <p class="text">SITA is a B2B-driven organisation. Logically, they investigate the interest and needs of
                their direct customers, such as airlines and airports. However, this would neglect a stakeholder, which
                is not significant at first glance with its low power and high interest, namely, consumers. Consumers,
                also known as cruise and airline passengers, are end-users. <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-sita">SITA’s direct customers do not only try to generate value for
                    themselves in terms of improved processes and reduced overhead cost but also try to improve
                    passengers’ experience to improve consumer loyalty and gain additional income streams.</span> For
                this reason, we conducted deep user research to gain more insights about the end-users and their pain

            <p class="ht3">Segment: Luxurious and travel-oriented</p>
            <p class="text">The four primary categories of market segmentation are demographic, psychographic,
                behavioral, and geographic segmentation. However, one can apply many additional tactics, including
                variants of the four main types (LOTAME, 2019). To come up with the different customer types and better
                scope our consumers, some desk research on cruise line consumers was conducted. Afterward, people who
                recently have been on a cruise trip were interviewed.</p>

            <p class="text">The desk research and interviews resulted in a behavioral and partly demographic
                segmentation. Since the project's scope is within the Netherlands, the segmentation is
                geographic to a certain level by default. The matrix exists out of 4 quadrants and is divided by
                luxurious and economic on the Y-axis and vacation-oriented and transport-oriented on the X-axis.
                <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">Luggage-free transport appeals to the luxurious
                    quadrants. Also, vacation-oriented travel is more popular than transport-oriented travel,
                    which is concluded by the interviews.</span> Therefore, the target group of the solution for
                this project will be in Quadrant A (left-top). In order to gain more empathy with the consumers,

            <div class="flex-column">
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Luggage on the cruise ship can differ at the end than from
                    the beginning. Therefore, there should be a control point on both sides.</p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Luggage destination can change. There should be clear
                    deadlines for changing luggage which should be communicated with the pickup service. </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Luggage should be traceable for the consumer. In other words,
                    the process should be transparent.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Consumers should get notifications of important information
                    such as luggage delays, if luggage reached the destination, or if the pickup service is on its way.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">The technology should be easy to use, and there should be
                    assistance available when the consumer is in need.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Selecting the luggage service should be togglable, and the
                    service itself should be easy to understand, including payments.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Interesting consumer pain points are below: </p>
            <div class="flex-column">
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Consumers do not keep track of the weight of bought goods on
                    the cruise. Therefore, luggage weight can differ.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Consumers' agendas can change, especially when tickets are
                    booked way in advance. Life happens, and last-minute things can occur, which can cause a delay in
                    the luggage handling process.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">It’s a new process that should be clear for consumers without
                    reading too much or doing much external stuff.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Consumers might bring higher quantities of luggage now that
                    they do not need to carry it anymore.
                </p>
                <p class="text column-child-4 border-left">Consumers with kids want to use the service as a stress
                    reliever. So, it shouldn’t give them extra steps.

                causing issues of adaption. If we had more time, we will design a

                rather than a web-based service. This would bring up further discussion around the tradeoff between
                making an application or still keeping it a web-based service.</p>
