            <p class="text">We decided to use the scrum method to control our work progress in the upfront of this
                project. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">We had a sprint planning meeting every Friday
                    afternoon in which we wrote down everything in
                    our mind that probably needed to be done in the ‘backlog’,</span> such as SWOT analysis and
                stakeholder
                analysis. Then we started our ‘sprint’. Every one of us was assigned several ‘backlogs’ to finish by the
                next Friday. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">During the week, we did 1-2 weekly ‘standup(s)’ to
                    exchange our progress and help each
                    other out.</span> And finally, it turns out to be efficient to work in this way. We had a quite nice
                time
                management and task division. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">It not only allowed us to
                    leverage our strengths to the greatest extent
                    but also gave us opportunities to challenge ourselves to practice outside our ‘comfort

            <p class="text">We conducted the cruise market study and investigated SITA’s current systems and processes,

                the supply chain, identified the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (TOWS analysis) of
                SITA as a service provider, and considered the different competitive forces that control the market
                dynamics (Porter’s Five Forces). <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The findings were complemented
                    with empirical data from user research

                    and
                    guide the new supplier relationships strategy</span>. Further, investigating the current
                processes and systems and customers and journeys provides an understanding of the different
                socio-technical aspects that must be considered in the design.

                technology. Currently, SITA is serving 95% of international destinations, including collaboration with
                over 2.500 airlines, airports, ground handlers, and governments (SITA, 2021). This means that SITA's

            <p class="text border-left">The global cruise ship market is dominated by three key parent companies which
                include Carnival, Royal Caribbean International (RCI), and Norwegian. Carnival possesses the highest
                market share at 37.1 %. Other smaller cruise lines possess a significant market share of 29.2%.</p>
            <p class="text border-left">The number of passengers grew by almost 60% between 2009 and 2019, until the
                pandemic resulted in a steep drop. The prospects for the cruise industry, however, seem optimistic as
                the economies emerge out of the pandemic, which can be validated by the two-fold increase in the number
                of passengers between 2020 and 2021.</p>
            <p class="text border-left">Europe is the second largest passenger source with 3.5 million passengers. The
                passenger source can be further drilled down to Germany: 1,068,900, France: 374,100, and Benelux:
                97,900.</p>
            <p class="text border-left">Most cruises in Amsterdam port operate between May and October representing a
                predictable seasonal trend.</p>

                analyzed by using the Karlijk matrix, which serves as a framework for analyzing modern purchasing
                (Kraljic, 1983). Two feasible relationships were analyzed:</p>
            <div class="two-column reveal_y_delay">
                <div class="caption column-child-2"><span class="s-highlight highlight-sita"><strong>Routine

                            Relationships:</strong></span>
                    The product or service is easily available in a routine transactional relationship. In such a
                    relationship, the actors are not deeply invested in each other, and the switching cost is low.
                    Therefore the purchasing risk is low. SITA may work with several delivery service providers to
                    arrange ad-hoc services in the given context.</div>
                <div class="caption column-child-2"><span class="s-highlight highlight-sita"><strong>Strategic
                            collaborative
                            relationships:</strong></span>
                    The buyer and supplier develop a partnership built on long-term contracts, fair agreements, and
                    collaborative support. While the risks involved are high, they are often shared, and strategic
                    interfirm collaboration results in higher responsiveness and superior performance of the supply
                    network (Kim & Lee, 2010). Strategic collaboration also facilitates inter-system communication
                    between SITA systems and delivery service providers. This can be instrumental in ensuring bags are
                    tracked, traced, and accounted for during the transfer process.</div>
            </div>

            <p class="text">The analysis shows that the benefits of a strategic collaborative relationship outweigh
                the routine transaction relationship in this case. Further insights from market data emphasize a
                predictable passenger influx that does not require an ad-hoc service. Therefore, <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-sita">we recommend strategic collaboration as the preferred
                    relationship model between SITA and the delivery service providers, which fosters reliability,

                    delivery providers in strategic collaboration.</span> The business environment of both parties -
                SITA and delivery providers – are complex. Therefore, the relationship must be clearly defined (De
                Backer & Rinaudo, 2019). Core reasons for joint-venture success need to be taken into account.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="text">To build this clear foundation, <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">SITA needs to
                    develop a platform where the concerned delivery company gets the needed data including but not
                    limited to delivery moments, places, and quantities. Furthermore, there should be confirmation when
                    the order is settled since passengers might have the possibility to change or cancel their order. On
                    top of that, delivery companies need to generate profit through the partnership.</span> Within the
                current scope of the project, the delivery distances are the same for all luggage, namely, the distance
                from the cruise port to the airport. In this case, a fixed price per volume can be considered. However,
                a price per volume per km should be considered if the service extends to more destinations.</p>
            <p class="text">Suggestions for delivery providers are worldwide players with experience in international
                deliveries and well-developed infrastructure such as DHL, FedEx, and DB Schenker. SITA should create a
                platform that communicates information and makes monetary transfers between the delivery company,
                passengers, cruise lines, and airlines automatically.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">Cruise lines are customers of SITA, but they are
                    also partners.</span> The existing partnership with cruise lines needs to be expanded and further
                defined. In addition, cruises have increased collaborations with the airline industry, which means
                collaborating with SITA could be a logical transition. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The
                    first partnerships can be used to co-develop the IT software solutions and perform beta runs of the
                    technology. The goal should be to create a transparent ecosystem that facilitates trust and data
                    share.</span></p>


            <p class="ht3">Structure</p>
            <p class="text">Some structural changes within SITA need to be made to facilitate the new service and its
                development, also known as transformational change. A clear definition of the changes needs to be
                structured (Alsher, 2018).<br>

                <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">First, the expertise, which currently includes knowledge about
                    borders, airlines, and airports, can be extended to cruise and luggage-free travel.</span> This
                implies that new departments in charge of the M-DCS and a system integration team need to be
                established. The department in charge of the integration can be divided into sub-departments as it grows
                categorized by the different software solutions. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">Second, the
                    already existing L-DCS department should be expanded. Furthermore, a department in charge of the
                    platform allowing passengers, cruise lines, airlines, and delivery service providers to communicate
                    automatically should be created.</span> Essential requirements that need to be addressed are:

            <p class="text">SITA is a B2B hardware company for the aviation industry. At the first glance, entering the
                cruise market, which requires similar solutions as the aviation industry regarding luggage handling,
                does not seem to require significant changes. However, <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">in order
                    to achieve overarching servitization to create true value for end-users, a passenger-centered
                    perspective should be taken.</span> SITA’s products will provide value for both customers and
                passengers. This means that both the passenger and the customer need to be kept in mind in the design
                process. Besides, the proposed solution focuses on the software instead of hardware. <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-sita">For this, we recommend looking into User-Centric Design Method
                    and the lean startup model.</span> A more elaborated explanation of these two methodologies can be
                seen here.

            <p class="text">We discussed the possible payment plans for the new service SITA will provide for the
                stakeholders.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>M-DCS</strong><br><span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The M-DCS can be licensed
                    to the cruise industry in
                    a similar way as the L-DCS systems are licensed to airports.</span> The costs associated with it are
                R&D and IT operational costs. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">Additional sources of revenue are
                    additional analytic services based on a subscription model.</span></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Delivery service</strong><br>The cost associated with the delivery service per
                delivery does not increase with more
                luggage (unless it exceeds the limit of each delivery). The cost is directly associated with the travel
                distance. When the quantity of luggage is high, the cost of delivery per luggage drops.

                This requires a different earning model than the licensing model that SITA is used to. The cash flow
                direction is shown below.</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper-landscape one-column reveal_y_delay" style="border:none; border-radius:0;">
                <img src="./asset/sita/5-cash flow direction.jpg" alt="overarched servitization" class="one-column-img">
            </div>
            <p class="text">There are two possible payment plans. The first one is to pay per luggage using a fixed bulk
                price calculated by using estimations of the amount that will be delivered that year. With this option,
                the risk is at the delivery service when passengers are not willing to take the service for whatever
                reason. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The cruise lines and airlines do not require a profit
                    on this since they can provide extra value to their passengers for free without taking any
                    effort.</span> The second option is, pay per vehicle, where SITA pays for the number of vehicles
                needed for the luggage. This way, the delivery service provider earns a profit margin each time a
                vehicle and a delivery man are needed. The risk is on SITA when the service is not used efficiently.
                <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">Therefore, we recommend a pay-per-luggage plan that generates
                    profit with a low level of risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Up-sales</strong><br><span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The cruise lines and
                    airlines will get more information about the passenger's whereabouts. Therefore, up-sales such as
                    providing the lounge service when there is a delay can be made.</span> However, these profits are
                not directly generated by using SITA’s software but indirectly due to the decision-making based on
                insights generated by SITA. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The pricing model for this software
                    can be similar to the pricing models of CRM systems which includes a flat subscription fee for the
                    enterprise with unlimited numbers of users. On top of this flat fee, modular pricing can be used for
                    each integration, feature, or anything specific (Pingrey, 2021).</span>

                also envision this solution in the long run to show its potential for future development. Two road maps
                are created. <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The tactical roadmap shows the values of different
                    stakeholders, needed data and technology, and partnership aspects of the provided business
                    solution.</span> This roadmap can be used for operational use within SITA's internal department.
                <span class="s-highlight highlight-sita">The strategic roadmap can be used for a more general and
                    high-level perspective, which can be showcased to SITA's stakeholders.</span>

                    data without having to share to reveal the data is secure multi-party computation (MPC).</span> MPC
                is a cryptography technique in which the output of the computation is visible to all parties. However,
                the inputs of each party remain encrypted and private. The solution mentioned in section 7.2 is based on
                data regarding arrivals and departures, which is less sensitive. However, valuable insights can be drawn
                if organizations choose to share sensitive data so that privacy is preserved (Evans et al., 2017). <span
                    class="s-highlight highlight-sita">Research in developing MPC protocols can play a vital role in
                    attracting new and existing partners to adopt SITA’s data platform.</span> As a facilitator of an
                MPC-based data platform, SITA can serve as an essential value creator for its partners and potentially
                monetize the data-sharing and computation services.
